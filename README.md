# Fully-Automated-Dishwashing-System
this research has undertaken a thorough
exploration to develop an innovative, fully automated dishwashing system by building upon existing solutions and advancing them to address the technical, economical, and social
dimensions of conventional dishwashing processes.
The proposed smart dishwashing system incorporates image
processing, machine learning, and a sophisticated three-degree
robotic arm to ensure a meticulous and efficient cleaning
process. The under-actuated robotic hand is strategically employed for grasping plates and dishes, showcasing a nuanced
approach to handling various types of tableware. To facilitate
a seamless operation, a network of conveyor belts is implemented. The use of under-actuated robotic hand delicately
retrieves and places each dish from the conveyor belt, placing
them precisely in a rack.
This intricate orchestration of robotic components and advanced technologies not only enhances efficiency but also significantly contributes to energy conservation, aligning seamlessly with the demands of the contemporary world. The
strategic use of multiple conveyor belts ensures a continuous
flow throughout the dishwashing process, maximizing the
systemâ€™s throughput and minimizing downtime.
By shifting the focus from studying various grasping models to creating a fully automated dishwashing system with
these advanced features, this research marks a groundbreaking
contribution to the evolution of dishwashing technology. It
underscores the transformative potential of intelligent systems,
offering a glimpse into a future where technology seamlessly
integrates with everyday tasks, promoting sustainability and
efficacy in domestic and industrial settings alike.
